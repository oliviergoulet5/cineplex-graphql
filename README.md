# cineplex-graphql
üéû The unofficial GraphQL interface for Cineplex' API.
<br/><br/>
‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still under development and is not yet ready for use.

## About

Before this project the only way to use live data from Cineplex was to use their REST API. For those who prefer GraphQL I made an interface (or wrapper) for them. 

Examples of things you can do with cineplex-graphql:
* Sort by multiple fields
* Filter with complex queries
* Paginate with Relay cursor-based pagination for speed and efficiency
